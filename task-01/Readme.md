# part-01
In this part i had found out the code using basic commands such as cd , ls and found out the directory and file by cracking the question after getting the required python file i executed it using python 3 and got the code as = "aHR0cHM6Ly9naX" 
# part-02
i did the same thing as done in part 1 and got the code as = "RodWIuY29tL1RoZ"
# part-03
here there was another problem as the required file was in other branch i used git checkout to change the branch and got the required file and copied it to main branch using the same git checkout and finally executed it and got = "Uh1bnRzbWFuNC9U"
# part-04
i went on to commit logs using git log and found out the file 
name and executed it and got the code as = "aGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs" 
  
at last i concatenated all the codes and decode it using echo <base64 encodedString> | base64 --decode 
the link finally i got is https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell
